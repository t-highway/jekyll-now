title: _ KAMBUCHA 
---

Because I'm interested in the cellulose material the kambucha creates I started to look into the Biofactory Canvas. Looking for information I found quite hard and confusing. There are so many papers out there and all have a slightly different focus. My goal was to produce cellulose, so what I wanted to know were the ideal condictions in which the acetobacter bacteria with yeast would have the largest yield. In the papers they used all different terms and slightly different approaches which made is hard to conclude what would be the 'best' circumstances. The most clear information I filled in the canvas.<br>
