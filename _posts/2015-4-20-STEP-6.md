title: _ WHAT I LEARNED
---
_ BioHacking is for me:
Looking for alternatives and tweak in a standard Biolab. By changing the tools or playing with living organisms you can explore or get what you want. There a re many important protocols when working with bacteria and fungi, but if something doesn’t work an alternative might. 

_ Basics:
- If you want to grow something you need to feed it. If you want to grow one thing and not another, you need to specify the nutrition for the species you want.
- Besides food there are many other factors that your species might prefer to grow faster. ( see: http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/graphics/BioFactory-canvas.pdf)
- If you want to grow one species avoid the others, that’s why you should work in a sterile environment. 

How to's
- Make the food! By making agar cultivation medium and pouring it in plates I created growth environments in petri dishes.
Step 1: measure the ingredients for you cultivation medium: (some: http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/annex/cultivation-media/) and pour them in a autoclavable bottle.
Step 2: autoclave the bottle with the ingredients. What is autoclaving? Wikipedia: An autoclave is a pressure chamber used to sterilize equipment and supplies by subjecting them to high pressure saturated steam at 121 °C (249°F) for around 15–20 minutes depending on the size of the load and the contents.
So a autoclavable bottle looks something like this:<img src="http://www.camlab.co.uk/images/thumbs/0009172.gif" alt="" /> 
It can stand high temperatures. To pressurise the ingredients of the bottle, place the bottle in a pressure cooker. Make sure the lid is closed but not completely otherwise the bottle might burst under all the pressure. Turn the pressure cooker on and what till it starts steaming. That’s when in the steam is under pressure at 121degrees. Now wait for 15-20 min, then remove from heat source. You can only open the pressure cooker when the ‘pressure pin’ is down. 
Step 3: Don’t open the bottle! Yet. Your ingredients have been sterilised, of you were to open the bottle it wouldn’t be sterile anymore. So to now pour the nutrition medium into a petri-dish a ‘sterile’ environment is needed. Different alternatives would work. 1 is a flame. The hot air of the flame does up and there fore create a sterile ‘umbrella’. 
 or build sterile hood (http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/4-sterile-hood/).
