title: _ HOW I USE BIOTECHNOLOGY
---

In my work I go on adventures to innovate in the fashion and textile industry.<br><br>
Imagine the world in 2050. <br>We have to deal with issues of overpopulation, food crisis, alternative resources and provide all these people with garments, and all of this in a sustainable way.<br>
With this world in mind I see great opportunities for nature to help us out. In 2050 we will grow textiles and have extreme personalization and customization. <br>
So I created a textile grown from mycelium. Mycelium are the roots of mushrooms and here work as a adhesive. By using mycelium in combination with natural waste materials I create naturally grown non wovens.<br>
Secondly I created textiles with pattern bacteria. These patterns just happens and are defined by the type of bacteria. Each person carries different bacteria with them and the bacteria will grow different each time.
