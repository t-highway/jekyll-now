title: _CONTAMINATION TESTS
---


I did a contanimation test over a period of a week. Last week we picked a place in the Waag Society to place our petridish open, for half an hour. I picked the space behind the 3D printers. This was the result after a week; some random bacteria and fungi growing. The yellow bacteria we also saw in the contamination tests of others. It's highly present at the Waag.  <br >
