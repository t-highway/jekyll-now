title: _MORE ON INCUBATOR AND MICROBES
---

I adjusted the files Pieter gave us (<a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/1-incubator/">Biohack Academy</a>) in Rhino. I took the SVG files and converted them to Illustrator files and imported those into Rhino. In Rhino I started playing around to adjust the design a bit and make it compatible with the 4mm acrylic I had bought.<br >

I did a contanimation test over a period of a week. Last week we picked a place in the Waag Society to place our petridish open, for half an hour. I picked the space behind the 3D printers. This was the result after a week; some random bacteria and fungi growing. The yellow bacteria we also saw in the contamination tests of others. It's highly present at the Waag.  <br >
