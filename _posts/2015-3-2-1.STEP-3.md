title: _MORE ON INCUBATOR AND MICROBES
---

I adjusted the files Pieter gave us (http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/1-incubator/) in Rhino. I took the SVG files and converted them to Illustrator files and imported those into Rhino. In Rhino I started playing around to adjust the design a bit and make it compatible with the 4mm acrylic I had bought.<br >
